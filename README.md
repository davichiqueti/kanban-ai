# Kanban AI

Kanban AI is an intelligent task management system that enhances traditional Kanban boards with AI-powered insights and reports by integrating LLMs (Large Language Models).  

## Problem Statement  
Traditional Kanban tools help visualize tasks, but they lack intelligence. Managers often rely on manual analysis to have a simple overview of their team's work, which can be time-consuming.
